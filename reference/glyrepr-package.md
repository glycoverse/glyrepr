# glyrepr: Representation for Glycan Compositions and Structures

Computational representations of glycan compositions and structures,
including details such as linkages, anomers, and substituents. Supports
varying levels of monosaccharide specificity (e.g., "Hex" or "Gal") and
ambiguous linkages. Provides robust parsing and generation of
IUPAC-condensed structure strings. Optimized for vectorized operations
on glycan structures, with efficient handling of duplications. As the
cornerstone of the glycoverse ecosystem, this package delivers the
foundational data structures that power glycomics and glycoproteomics
analysis workflows.
