`glyrepr` provides two important representations of glycans: glycan compositions and glycan structures.
This package is the core of `glycoverse` ecosystem,
as it provides the basic data structures and functions for representing and manipulating glycans.

In fact, the functions in this packages are heavily used by other `glycoverse`
packages such as [glyparse](https://github.com/glycoverse/glyparse) 
and [glymotif](https://github.com/glycoverse/glymotif), 
which you are probably already using or will use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of glyrepr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("glycoverse/glyrepr")
```

## Example

```{r setup}
library(glyrepr)

# Create glycan compositions
glycan_composition(
  c(Man = 5, GlcNAc = 2),
  c(Man = 3, Gal = 2, GlcNAc = 4, Fuc = 1, Neu5Ac = 2)
)

# Parse IUPAC-condensed glycan text representation
# `glyrepr` supports IUPAC-condensed glycan text representation natively.
# For other formats like WURCS or glycoCT, use the `glyparse` package.
# For example, the following two glycan structures are equivalent:
structures <- as_glycan_structure(c("GlcNAc(b1-4)GlcNAc", "Man(a1-2)GlcNAc"))

# Get the composition of a glycan structure
as_glycan_composition(structures)

# Count the number of given residues
count_mono(structures, "Hex")
count_mono(glycan_composition(c(Man = 3, GlcNAc = 2, Gal = 2)), "Hex")
```

## Related work

This package is inspired by two Python packages: 
[glypy](https://github.com/mobiusklein/glypy) and [glycowork](https://github.com/BojarLab/glycowork?tab=readme-ov-file).
In R, `glyrepr` achieves the same functionality, but has been optimized for vectorized operations.
