This package is a wrapper of 'igraph' for representing glycan structures in R. 
It introduces a vectorized S3 class called "glyrepr_structure" along with a suite of functions 
to create and manipulate glycan structures efficiently.

If you are a glycomics or glycoproteomics researcher, 
you likely won't need to interact with this package directly.
All you need to know is that it defines the "glyrepr_structure" S3 class 
to represent glycan structures in a vectorized manner,
so you won't be surprised if you encounter this name elsewhere in `glycoverse.`

In fact, the functions in this packages are heavily used by other `glycoverse`
packages such as [glyparse](https://github.com/glycoverse/glyparse) and 
[glymotif](https://github.com/glycoverse/glymotif), 
which you are probably already using or will use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of glyrepr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("glycoverse/glyrepr")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(glyrepr)
library(igraph)

# Create glycan compositions
comp <- glycan_composition(
  c(Man = 5, GlcNAc = 2),
  c(Man = 3, Gal = 2, GlcNAc = 4, Fuc = 1, Neu5Ac = 2)
)
comp

# Create glycan structures
# Here we manually create an igraph object and convert it to a glycan structure.
# In practice, you should use the `glyparse` package to create glycan structures
# from IUPAC names or other formats.
graph <- make_graph(~ 1-+2, 2-+3)
igraph::V(graph)$mono <- c("Glc", "Gal", "Glc")
igraph::V(graph)$sub <- ""
igraph::E(graph)$linkage <- c("b1-4", "b1-4")
graph$anomer <- "a1"
graph$alditol <- FALSE
glycan <- glycan_structure(graph)
glycan

# Get the composition of a glycan structure
as_glycan_composition(glycan)
```
