`glyrepr` provides two important representations of glycans: glycan compositions and glycan structures.
This package is the core of `glycoverse` ecosystem,
as it provides the basic data structures and functions for representing and manipulating glycans.

In fact, the functions in this packages are heavily used by other `glycoverse`
packages such as [glyparse](https://github.com/glycoverse/glyparse) 
and [glymotif](https://github.com/glycoverse/glymotif), 
which you are probably already using or will use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of glyrepr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("glycoverse/glyrepr")
```

## Role in `glycoverse`

As the cornerstone of the `glycoverse` ecosystem, 
this package provides two fundamental data structures for representing glycans: 
`glycan_composition()` and `glycan_structure()`.
These specialized data types are what distinguish `glycoverse` from other omics analysis frameworks,
serving as the foundation for higher-level packages like `glymotif`, 
which build upon them to perform advanced glycan analysis.

## Example

```{r setup}
library(glyrepr)

# Create glycan compositions
glycan_composition(
  c(Man = 5, GlcNAc = 2),
  c(Man = 3, Gal = 2, GlcNAc = 4, Fuc = 1, Neu5Ac = 2)
)

# Parse IUPAC-condensed glycan text representation
# `glyrepr` supports IUPAC-condensed glycan text representation natively.
# For other formats like WURCS or glycoCT, use the `glyparse` package.
# For example, the following two glycan structures are equivalent:
structures <- as_glycan_structure(c("GlcNAc(b1-4)GlcNAc", "Man(a1-2)GlcNAc"))

# Get the composition of a glycan structure
as_glycan_composition(structures)

# Count the number of given residues
count_mono(structures, "Hex")
count_mono(glycan_composition(c(Man = 3, GlcNAc = 2, Gal = 2)), "Hex")
```
