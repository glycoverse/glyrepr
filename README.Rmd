This package is a wrapper of 'igraph' for representing glycan structures in R. 
It introduces a vectorized S3 class called "glyrepr_structure" along with a suite of functions 
to create and manipulate glycan structures efficiently.

If you are a glycomics or glycoproteomics researcher, 
you likely won't need to interact with this package directly.
All you need to know is that it defines the "glyrepr_structure" S3 class 
to represent glycan structures in a vectorized manner,
so you won't be surprised if you encounter this name elsewhere in `glycoverse.`

In fact, the functions in this packages are heavily used by other `glycoverse`
packages such as [glyparse](https://github.com/glycoverse/glyparse) and 
[glymotif](https://github.com/glycoverse/glymotif), 
which you are probably already using or will use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of glyrepr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("glycoverse/glyrepr")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(glyrepr)

glycan <- n_glycan_core()
print(glycan, verbose = TRUE)
```
