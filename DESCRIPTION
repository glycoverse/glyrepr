Description: Computational representations of glycan compositions and structures,
    including details such as linkages, anomers, and substituents. Supports varying
    levels of monosaccharide specificity (e.g., "Hex" or "Gal") and ambiguous linkages.
    Provides robust parsing and generation of IUPAC-condensed structure strings.
    Optimized for vectorized operations on glycan structures, with efficient handling
    of duplications. As the cornerstone of the glycoverse ecosystem, this package
    delivers the foundational data structures that power glycomics and glycoproteomics
    analysis workflows.
