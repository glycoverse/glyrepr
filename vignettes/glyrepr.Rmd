Welcome to the world of glycan analysis! 
If you've ever tried to work with glycans computationally, 
you know the struggle: 
these tree-like molecules are notoriously difficult to represent and analyze compared to their linear cousins like proteins or DNA. 
That's where `glyrepr` comes to the rescue.

Think of `glyrepr` as your **glycan translator** — it teaches your computer how to "speak glycan" fluently. 
Whether you're dealing with compositions (what's in the glycan) or structures (how it's connected), 
this package has got you covered.

```{r setup}
library(glyrepr)
```

## Quick Start: What Are We Talking About?

Before we dive in, 
let's establish our vocabulary. 
Don't worry — it's simpler than it sounds!

| Term | What It Means | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Composition** | The "ingredients list" — how many of each sugar | `Hex(5)HexNAc(2)` |
| **Structure** | The "blueprint" — how sugars are connected | `Man(a1-3)Man(b1-4)GlcNAc` |
| **Monosaccharide** | A single sugar unit (the building blocks) | `Gal`, `Man`, `Hex` |
| **Linkage** | The "glue" between sugars | `a1-3`, `b1-4` |
| **Substitution** | Chemical decorations on sugars | `6Ac`, `3Me` |

🔍 **Pro tip**: 
We distinguish between **generic** sugars (like mystery boxes labeled "Hex") and **concrete** sugars (like specific boxes labeled "Galactose").

## Part 1: Compositions — The Easy Start

Let's start with something straightforward: 
glycan compositions. 
Think of these as ingredient lists for your favorite recipes.

### Creating Your First Compositions

There are three ways to create compositions, 
each with its own superpower:

**Method 1: The Direct Approach**
```{r}
# Just tell R what you have
glycan_composition(c(Hex = 5, HexNAc = 2), c(Gal = 1, GalNAc = 1))
```

**Method 2: The Programmatic Way**
```{r}
# Perfect when you're processing data from files or databases
comp_list <- list(c(Hex = 5, HexNAc = 2), c(Gal = 1, GalNAc = 1))
as_glycan_composition(comp_list)
```

**Method 3: The Parser**
```{r}
# Copy-paste from your mass spec software? No problem!
as_glycan_composition(c("Hex(5)HexNAc(2)", "Gal(1)GalNAc(1)"))
```

### The Magic of Colors 🌈

Here's something cool: 
when you run these examples in your R console, 
you'll see the concrete monosaccharides (like Gal and GalNAc) displayed in beautiful colors! 
These follow the [SNFG standard](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/glycans/snfg.html) — the universal "color code" for glycans. 
Think of it as the glycan rainbow 🌈.

### Smart Counting with `count_mono()`

Now here's where `glyrepr` shows its intelligence:

```{r}
comp <- glycan_composition(
  c(Hex = 5, HexNAc = 2),          # generic sugars
  c(Gal = 1, Man = 1, GalNAc = 1)  # concrete sugars
)

# How many galactose residues?
count_mono(comp, "Gal")

# How many hexose residues? (This includes Gal and Man!)
count_mono(comp, "Hex")
```

Notice how `count_mono()` is smart enough to know that galactose and mannose are both hexoses? 
That's the power of understanding glycan hierarchies!

## Part 2: Structures — Where the Magic Happens

Compositions are nice, 
but structures are where `glyrepr` truly shines. 
This is like going from knowing the ingredients to understanding the actual recipe and cooking method.

### Your First Glycan Structures

Let's work with some real glycan structures. 
These strings below are called the "IUPAC-condensed" glycan text representations.
They might look cryptic, 
but they're actually quite readable once you get the hang of it.
To learn about them, check out [this article](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyrepr/articles/iupac.html).

```{r}
iupacs <- c(
  "Man(a1-3)[Man(a1-6)]Man(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-",  # The famous N-glycan core
  "Gal(b1-3)GalNAc(a1-",                                  # O-glycan core 1
  "Gal(b1-3)[GlcNAc(b1-6)]GalNAc(a1-",                    # O-glycan core 2
  "Man(a1-3)[Man(a1-6)]Man(a1-3)[Man(a1-6)]Man(a1-",      # A branched mannose tree
  "GlcNAc6Ac(b1-4)Glc3Me(a1-"                             # With some decorations
)

struc <- as_glycan_structure(iupacs)
struc
```

### The Secret Sauce: Unique Structure Optimization

Here's where `glyrepr` gets really clever. 
Notice that "# Unique structures: 5" message? 
This isn't just informational — it's the key to lightning-fast performance.

Let's see this optimization in action:

```{r}
# Create a big dataset with lots of repetition
large_struc <- rep(struc, 1000)  # 5,000 structures total
large_struc
```

Still showing "# Unique structures: 5"! 
This means `glyrepr` is storing only 5 unique graphs internally, 
not 5,000. 
This is like having a smart library system that stores only one copy of each book, 
no matter how many people want to read it.

### Performance That Will Blow Your Mind 🚀

Let's put this to the test:

```{r}
library(tictoc)

tic("Converting 5 structures")
result_small <- convert_mono_type(struc, "generic")
toc()

tic("Converting 5,000 structures")
result_large <- convert_mono_type(large_struc, "generic")
toc()
```

**Mind = blown!** 🤯 
The performance is nearly identical because `glyrepr` only processes each unique structure once, 
then cleverly expands the results.

### Structure Manipulation Tools

`glyrepr` comes with several handy tools for structure manipulation:

**Strip away the connections:**
```{r}
remove_linkages(struc)
```

**Remove the decorations:**
```{r}
# Let's look at our decorated structure first
struc[5]

# Now remove the decorations (6Ac and 3Me)
remove_substituents(struc[5])
```

## Part 3: Conversions and Integrations

### From Structure to Composition

Ever wondered what's actually in those complex structures? 
Easy:

```{r}
comp <- as_glycan_composition(struc)
comp
```

### Back to Strings

Need to export your data or use it elsewhere?

```{r}
# Get the original string representations
as.character(struc)
as.character(comp)
```

### Playing Nice with the Tidyverse

`glyrepr` objects are first-class citizens in the tidyverse:

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tibble))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))

df <- tibble(
  id = seq_along(struc),
  structures = struc,
  names = c("N-glycan core", "Core 1", "Core 2", "Branched Man", "Decorated")
)

df %>% 
  mutate(n_man = count_mono(structures, "Man")) %>%
  filter(n_man > 1)
```
