\title{Convert Glycan Structure to IUPAC-like Sequence}
\usage{
structure_to_iupac(glycan)
}
\arguments{
\item{glycan}{An igraph object representing a glycan structure, or a glyrepr_structure vector}
}
\value{
A character string representing the IUPAC-like sequence, or a vector of sequences if input is vectorized
}
\description{
Convert a glycan structure to a sequence representation in the form of
mono(linkage)mono, with branches represented by square brackets [].
The backbone is chosen as the longest path, and for branches, linkages are
ordered lexicographically with smaller linkages on the backbone.
}
\section{Sequence Format}{
The sequence follows the format mono(linkage)mono, where:
\itemize{
\item mono: monosaccharide name (e.g., Glc, GlcNAc, Man)
\item linkage: glycosidic linkage (e.g., b1-4, a1-3)
\item Branches are enclosed in square brackets []
}
}

\section{Backbone Selection}{
The backbone is selected as the longest path in the tree. For branches,
the same rule applies recursively.
}

\section{Linkage Comparison}{
Linkages are compared lexicographically:
\enumerate{
\item First by anomeric configuration: ? > b > a
\item Then by first position: ? > numbers (numerically)
\item Finally by second position: ? > numbers (numerically)
}

Smaller linkages are placed on the backbone, larger ones in branches.

# Simple linear structure
structure_to_iupac(o_glycan_core_1())

# Branched structure  
structure_to_iupac(n_glycan_core())

# Vectorized structures
structs <- glycan_structure(o_glycan_core_1(), n_glycan_core())
