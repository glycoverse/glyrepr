\title{Create a Glycan Composition}
\usage{
glycan_composition(...)

is_glycan_composition(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Named integer vectors.
Names are monosaccharides or substituents, values are numbers of residues.
Monosaccharides and substituents can be mixed in the same composition.}

\item{x}{A list of named integer vectors.}
}
\value{
A glyrepr_composition object.
}
\description{
Create a glycan composition from a list of named integer vectors.
Compositions can contain both monosaccharides and substituents.
}
\details{
Compositions can contain:
\itemize{
\item Monosaccharides: either generic (e.g., "Hex", "HexNAc") or concrete
(e.g., "Glc", "Gal"). All monosaccharides in a composition must be
of the same type.
\item Substituents: e.g., "Me", "Ac", "S". These can be mixed with either
generic or concrete monosaccharides.
}

Components are automatically sorted with monosaccharides first (according to
their order in the monosaccharides table), followed by substituents (according
to their order in \code{available_substituents()}).
}
\examples{
# A vector with one composition (generic monosaccharides)
glycan_composition(c(Hex = 5, HexNAc = 2))
# A vector with multiple compositions
glycan_composition(c(Hex = 5, HexNAc = 2), c(Hex = 5, HexNAc = 4, dHex = 2))
# Residues are reordered automatically
glycan_composition(c(HexNAc = 1, Hex = 2))
# An example for generic monosaccharides
glycan_composition(c(Hex = 2, HexNAc = 1))
# An example for concrete monosaccharides
glycan_composition(c(Glc = 2, Gal = 1))
# Compositions with substituents
glycan_composition(c(Glc = 1, S = 1))
glycan_composition(c(Hex = 3, HexNAc = 2, Me = 1, Ac = 1))
# Substituents are sorted after monosaccharides
glycan_composition(c(S = 1, Gal = 1, Ac = 1, Glc = 1))
