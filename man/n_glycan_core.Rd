\section{N-Glycan Core}{
\strong{N-Glycans} are branched oligosaccharides that are bound, most commonly,
via GlcNAc to an Asn residue of the protein backbone.
A common motif of all N-glycans is the \strong{chitobiose core},
composed of three mannose and two GlcNAc moieties,
which is commonly attached to the protein backbone via GlcNAc.
The mannose residue is branched and connected via α1,3- and α1,6-glycosidic
linkages to the two other mannose building blocks.

\section{O-Glycan Core}{
\strong{O-Glycans} are highly abundant in extracellular proteins.
Generally, O-glycans are extended following four major core structures:
\strong{core 1}, \strong{core 2}, core 3, and core 4.
The first two are by far the most common core structures in O-glycosylation
and are found throughout the body.

\strong{core 1}:
